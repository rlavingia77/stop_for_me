People sometimes chase buses (perhaps to no avail) because drivers leave early or choose to ignore the nearby passengers looking to board the bus. In the cold, it can be very frustrating to miss a bus by mere seconds.   We want to notify drivers of passenger arrivals, especially in a certain  proximity of their bus stop (and their bus). This can be done through the  automated use of a background-running mobile app using location services.
